Using static imports in Rest Assured,

without specifying the name of the Class or creating an object of the Class.
For example, instead of writing RestAssured.given().when()…,
we can simply write do a static import of io.restassured.RestAssured.*
and directly write given.when()….
which is a bit simpler and easier to read
